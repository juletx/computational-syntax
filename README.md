# Computational Syntax

Computational Syntax slides and exercises. This is a compulsory 4.5‐credit course in the HAP/LAP master. It will be presented during the first semester of the course.

## Preconditions

* It is recommendable to have a basic knowledge of the basic concepts of Linguistics (those that were
taught in secondary school). It is also helpful to know the concepts presented in this master's
“Foundations of Linguistics” course

* Programming: it is interesting to understand the basic concepts of programming. Related to this, the
course on “Introduction to programming” or a similar one is recommendable

* It is helpful to have a basic understanding of regular expressions

## Objectives

* Presentation of the main approaches for the computational treatment of syntax. Among others,
context‐free grammars, finite‐state syntax, and statistical models. Several formalisms will be
presented. We will also present a main overview of the main algorithms for Tagging, Chunking and
Parsing.

* Overview of the role that computational morphology and syntax play on the applications that make
use of language technology.
